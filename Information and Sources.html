<br>"Turn of the taps while brushing"
<br>
<br>"Use buckets instead of showers"
<br>
<br>"Avoid bath"
<br>
<br>These are all refrains we hear in the context of responsible water use. But beyond the obvious, are we actually aware of how much water it takes for each of our daily tasks? Decades of renouncing showers couldn't redeem all the water it took to manufacture your leather belt. And get this, it takes more water to make dried apples than apple juice. Seriously.
<br>
<br><b>What is water footprint?</b>
<br>Simply put, it's a way to measure how much water you indirectly consume. It includes the water used to grow your food, make your clothes, and even produce the stuff you buy. Being aware of your water footprint helps you make eco-friendly choices and save this precious resource for a greener planet. 
<br>
<br>When it comes to our eating habits, we're painfully underinformed on how much water it actually took to put that food on on our table. <a href="https://www.watercalculator.org/footprint/foods-big-water-footprint/">The main contributor to a person's water footprint is their diet, which has a much greater impact compared to activities like long showers or frequent toilet flushing. While these water uses matter too, they have a smaller effect on the overall water footprint.</a>
<br>
<br><b>Why is the waterfootprint of food so big?</b>
<br>There are 3 kinds of water footprints:
<br>	- <a href="https://www.watercalculator.org/footprint/rainwater-green-water-footprint/">Green: The amount of rainwater required (evaporated or used directly) to make an item – for food this refers to dry farming where crops receive only rainwater.</a>
<br>	- <a href="https://www.watercalculator.org/footprint/farmers-use-drip-irrigation/">Blue: The amount of surface water and groundwater required (evaporated or used directly) to produce an item – for food this mainly refers to crop irrigation.</a>
<br>	- <a href="https://www.watercalculator.org/footprint/what-is-a-water-footprint/">Grey: The amount of freshwater required to dilute the wastewater generated in manufacturing, in order to maintain water quality , as determined by state and local standards – for food this refers to things like field and farm runoff.</a>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Which food item has the most water footprint?</b>
<br>The water footprint of <em>meat and animal products</em>, such as dairy and eggs, is notably high due to their reliance on water-intensive animal feed.

<br>The table shows the difference between the water footprints of average factory farm or feedlot-raised animals(whose primary feed is corn or soy) and animals raised on a pasture(whose primary feed is forage). It should be noted that the only way to precisely measure water use in a particular operation is to conduct farm-level water use audits or water footprint assessments.
<br>
<br>
<br>This program is but a drop in the bucket when it comes to spreading awareness about water footprints of food, as the data presented and the calculations done are by no means an exact accounting of anyone's water use. This calculator provides a rough overview, a glance at how your food habits affect your water footprint. It is an estimate to help the users understand their behaviours and reflect on how to use less water.
<br>
<br>
<br>FUTURE IDEAS:
<br>
<br>Aim: Create a web or mobile app that helps people reduce their carbon footprint by tracking their energy consumption, transportation, and waste. 
<br>
<br>Features:
<br>
<br>- Data visualization to help people understand the impact of their actions.
<br>
<br>- Energy: 
<br>	- Potential savings and benefits of adopting renewable energy sources such as solar panels or wind turbines. 
<br>	- Cost comparisons
<br>	- Energy generation forecasts
<br>	- Environmental impact assessments.
<br>
<br>- Daily Water Usage: 
<br>	- Calculate water consumption based on inputs such as shower duration, faucet usage, and toilet flushes.
<br>	- Calculate reports based on a time period.
<br>	- Suggestions for reducing water consumption.
<br>
<br>- Daily Expense Tracker: Prompt users to enter their expenses and categorize them automatically. 
<br>	- It can generate reports
<br>	- Visualize spending patterns
<br>	- Budgeting suggestions.
