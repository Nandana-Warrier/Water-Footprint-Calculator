    'Tip1': 'Waste less:\n -  Because it takes a lot of water to get food to people’s plates, wasted food also means wasted water.\n -  The easiest and perhaps most effective thing to do is to plan out meals before heading to the store.',
    'Tip2': 'Choose Local Food:\n - Supporting local food production can help preserve water resources by keeping water usage for growing food within the local area. This reduces the need for transporting water across long distances.'},
    'meat': {
        'Tip1': 'Choose Better Meat: Choose pasture raised meat as much as possible as despite negligible differences between water footprints, their impact on water resources are different:\n - Pasture-fed (Green Water Footprint): Uses forage as feed grown from rainwater and manure is used as fertilisers.\n - Conventional (Blue Water Footprint): Uses feed like corn that need irrigation and animal waste is turned into manure lagoons that can pollute surrounding waters.',
        'Tip2': 'Eat Less Meat: On average, the water footprint of a vegan or vegetarian is around half that of a meat eater. Eating less meat and replacing it with less water-intensive plant-based alternatives can reduce water footprints'},
    'produce': {
        'Tip1': "Choose Organic:\n - Organic farms usually don't use pesticides or synthetic fertilisers which could run off of farm fields and pollute nearby waters. \n - Soils at organic farms tend to be much better at retaining nutrients and moisture, which reduces the risk of groundwater pollution.\n - Buying products grown organically helps support farms that are making big efforts to reduce water pollution, which means those products have a smaller gray water footprint.",

        'Tip1': 'In addition to growing the ingredients, processed foods require water for things like cleaning the food and machinery, pre-cooking the food, producing fuel for delivery and making packaging materials. Cutting back and replacing packaged foods with locally grown, organic alternatives can make a significant impact on your water footprint.',

        'Tip1': 'Reducing dairy consumption can help reduce the water footprint due to the significant water-intensive processes involved in producing feed grains for dairy cows and the potential water pollution caused by dairy farms ultimately leading to lower water consumption and environmental impact.',
        'Tip2': ''}, 'milled flour': {
        'Tip1': 'Reducing the consumption of milled flours and opting for whole grains like corn can contribute to lowering the water footprint, as processing milled flours requires additional water, while whole grains retain more of their natural water content, leading to more water-efficient food choices.',
