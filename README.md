"Turn of the taps while brushing"

"Use buckets instead of showers"

"Avoid baths"

These are all refrains we hear in the context of responsible water use. But beyond the obvious, are we actually aware of how much water it takes for each of our daily tasks? Decades of renouncing showers couldn't redeem all the water it took to manufacture your leather belt. And get this, it takes more water to make dried apples than apple juice. Seriously.

This program is but a drop in the bucket when it comes to spreading awareness about water footprints of food, as the data presented and the calculations done are by no means an exact accounting of anyone's water use. This calculator provides a rough overview, a glance at how your food habits affect your water footprint. It is an estimate to help the users understand their behaviours and reflect on how to use less water.

Simply put, it's a way to measure how much water you indirectly consume. It includes the water used to grow your food, make your clothes, and even produce the stuff you buy. Being aware of your water footprint helps you make eco-friendly choices and save this precious resource for a greener planet.
