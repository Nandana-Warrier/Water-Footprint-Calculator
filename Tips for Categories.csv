meat,"Choose Better Meat: Choose pasture raised meat as much as possible as despite negligible differences between water footprints, their impact on water resources are different:
 - Pasture-fed (Green Water Footprint): Uses forage as feed grown from rainwater and manure is used as fertilisers.
 - Conventional (Blue Water Footprint): Uses feed like corn that need irrigation and animal waste is turned into manure lagoons that can pollute surrounding waters.","Eat Less Meat: On average, the water footprint of a vegan or vegetarian is around half that of a meat eater. Eating less meat and replacing it with less water-intensive plant-based alternatives can reduce water footprints",,,
produce,"Choose Organic:
 - Organic farms usually don't use pesticides or synthetic fertilisers which could run off of farm fields and pollute nearby waters. 
 - Soils at organic farms tend to be much better at retaining nutrients and moisture, which reduces the risk of groundwater pollution.
 - Buying products grown organically helps support farms that are making big efforts to reduce water pollution, which means those products have a smaller gray water footprint.",,,,
processed foods,"In addition to growing the ingredients, processed foods require water for things like cleaning the food and machinery, pre-cooking the food, producing fuel for delivery and making packaging materials. Cutting back and replacing packaged foods with locally grown, organic alternatives can make a significant impact on your water footprint.",,,,
